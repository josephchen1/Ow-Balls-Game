# Joseph’s Ow-Balls

Just a little starter project for CSC405: Algorithms & Software. We were to make an array of circles with certain attributes, and have them interact with each other within a confined space.

## Getting Started

You would probably need Processing 3.5.3 or higher, although older versions should usually work. 

## Extra Features

When you left-click within the constraints, the balls within a specific radius of the mouse pointer will move towards the pointer. In addition, when balls collide or overlap, they will display “ow,” thus the name Ow-Balls. 

## Release History
* 0.1.0 
  * The first proper release
